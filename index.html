    <h1>Malaria is causing over 660'000 deaths each year!</h1>
    <p>As the header suggests, malaria causes hundreds of thousands of deaths each year - and it's preventable!</p>
	<p>		I am partially immune to the hideous disease, but not everyone is. If we can raise awareness of this disease, we can help put a stop to the hundreds of thousands of deaths each year.</p>

	<h2>We can prevent malaria using these steps:</h2>
	<h4>Take Antimalarial Medications:</h4>
	<li>If you're traveling to an area where malaria is endemic, consult with a healthcare professional to determine the appropriate antimalarial medication for your destination.</li>
	<li>Take the prescribed medication as directed, starting before your trip, during your stay, and for the recommended period after returning.</li>
	<h4>Use Insect Repellent:</h4>
	<li>Apply insect repellent containing DEET, picaridin, or other recommended ingredients to exposed skin and clothing.</li>
	<li>Reapply repellent as needed, following the product's instructions.</li>
	<h4>Wear Protective Clothing:</h4>
	<li>Wear long-sleeved shirts, long pants, socks, and closed shoes to minimize exposed skin.</li>
	<li>Consider treating clothing with permethrin, an insect repellent that can be applied to clothing for added protection.</li>
	<h4>Use Bed Nets:</h4>
	<li>Sleep under an insecticide-treated bed net, especially if you're in an area where malaria is prevalent.</li>
	<li>Ensure that the bed net is properly installed, tucked under the mattress, and free of holes.</li>
	<h4>Choose Accommodations with Screening:</h4>
	<li>When selecting accommodations, choose places with screened windows and doors to prevent mosquitoes from entering.</li>
	<h4>Avoid Peak Mosquito Activity:</h4>
	<li>Mosquitoes that transmit malaria are most active during dawn and dusk. Avoid outdoor activities during these times whenever possible.</li>
	<h4>Eliminate Standing Water:</h4>
	<li>Mosquitoes breed in standing water. Reduce the risk by emptying, covering, or treating containers that can collect and hold water, such as flowerpots, buckets, and clogged gutters.</li>
	<h4>Stay Informed:</h4>
	<li>Stay informed about the malaria risk in the area you are visiting.</li>
	<li>Be aware of the signs and symptoms of malaria so that you can seek prompt medical attention if you experience symptoms after returning from a malaria-endemic area.</li>
	<h4>Pregnant Women and Young Children:</h4>
	<li>Pregnant women and young children are particularly vulnerable to malaria. Special precautions may be needed, so consult with a healthcare professional.</li>
	<h4>Consult a Healthcare Professional:</h4>
	<li>Before traveling to a malaria-endemic area, consult with a healthcare professional or travel medicine specialist to get personalized advice based on your health, travel itinerary, and other factors</li>
	<p>		Remember that malaria prevention is a combination of various measures, and it's essential to follow them consistently to minimize the risk of infection. If you develop symptoms such as fever, chills, headache, and muscle aches after returning from a malaria-endemic area, seek medical attention promptly. Early diagnosis and treatment are crucial for a positive outcome.</p>
